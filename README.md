# Motors Dashboard System

This system features three motors: DC motor, a servo motor and a stepper motor. An LCD displays three options : (1) DC, (2) Srv (Servo motor) and (3) Stp (Stepper motor), and using a keypad, you enter the number of the motor you want to turn on. When you choose DC, you choose between two directions: (1) Cw and (2) CCW, then you can choose between 5 different speeds while speed 1 equals zero. If you chose option (2) Servo motor, you enter the angle using the keypad and the motor rotates immediately. Finally, if you chose the third option Stepper motor, you choose between CW and CCW, then enter the angle, and the motor rotates.

The three motors are attached to three different timers on the ATmega32, so they can operate in parallel.
